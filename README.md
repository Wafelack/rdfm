# Introduction

RDFM is the Rusty DotFiles Manager, based on a homemade linking system
and configured by a simple file ; it is intended for everyone who needs
an easy and reliable way to manage and share dotfiles.

# Installation

- To install RDFM you can either:

1. Run `cargo install rdfm`
2. Download the latest binary from [the releases page](https://github.com/wafelack/rdfm/releases)
3. [Build the project from source](#build-from-source)

# Getting Started

## Setting up rdfm

RDFM can be set up with the command `rdfm setup`, that will create a `~/.dotfiles/` directory and a `~/.dotfiles/dotfiles.rdfm` file.

## Adding dotfiles

You can add dotfiles to the `~/.dotfiles/dotfiles.rdfm` file with the `rdfm add $src $dest` command
that can be used as following:

```bash
$ rdfm add ~/.vim/ vim/.vim
Successfully added `/home/wafelack/.vim/` to dotfiles as `vim/.vim`
$ cat ~/.dotfiles/dotfiles.rdfm
# This file is created by rdfm and is not intended for manual editing.
/home/wafelack/.vim/->/home/wafelack/.dotfiles/vim/.vim
$
```

## Removing dotfiles

To remove dotfiles from `~/.dotfiles/dotfiles.rdfm`, you can use the `rdfm remove $pattern` command
that will remove every line containing one or more occurences of `$pattern`.

## Proceeding linking

To proceed linking and copy your dotfiles to the `~/.dotfiles` folder, you'll use the `rdfm proceed` command.

## Pulling dotfiles

To pull dotfiles from an external repo, you can use `rdfm pull $repo` as following:

```bash
$ rdfm pull https://github.com/wafelack/dotfiles
Successfully pulled `https://github.com/wafelack/dotfiles` into `~/.dotfiles`
$
```
